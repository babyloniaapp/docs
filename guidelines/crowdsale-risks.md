## Risks and cautions involved with the Crowdsale #1
Please read the following cautions, risks, and guidelines before you decide to buy **Baby Token**. We tried to put them together as compact as possible, not to waste your time and make it a boring bla bla bla.

 1. Babylonia is a young and potential start-up. In the past year we worked hard and built much, and we haven't started yet. Try to know us better before buying our token. Read our story, see our contents on Twitter, study our principles and examine our work on GitHub. 
 2. Investing into a start-up is risky, DO NOT spend all your money or your savings on buying the **BABY Token**. We have capped it to 100,000 $BABY per wallet.
 3. The Baby Token can't be sold until the next phase of development, which is called "Open Market", where we deploy liquidity on the DEX. That may take 3-6 months.
 4. Do not buy any unknown tokens including the Baby Token with your **main** wallet (account), where all your saving money, tokens, and assets are. Always have a **secondary** wallet for unsafe engagements. This decrease the risk of being exploited or hacked.
 5. Our Crowdsale does not have a softcap. The investment and bought tokens cannot return.
 6. We tested all of your web3 and token features for a month, however the unforeseen bugs and problems may arise. Please report back the bugs and issues by email or leave a message in our social media groups.
 7. Make sure what token and where you are sending the tokens, we can't recover your assets if you have transferred the wrong tokens to the ICO contracts.
 8. The easiest and best method to buy the Baby Token is through the **Crowdsale #1 Method 2**, where you do not need to login or connect to our web3 services.
 9. Always **try to buy small amount of Baby Token** to ensure the transfer is completed, and you have received the Baby Tokens immediately. Then you may place a larger order.
 10. Double-check the copy & paste functions of your computer or your phone, make sure that the tokens are being sent to the correct contract.
