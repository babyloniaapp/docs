## Connecting with MetaMask wallet

MetaMask can be downloaded on Chrome and Firefox, or on iOS and Android if you‚Äôre a mobile user. For the purposes of this tutorial, we‚Äôll use the Firefox version, but the instructions will be more or less the same for every platform.

Firstly, you‚Äôll want to head over to the MetaMask [Download page](https://metamask.io/download.html). From there, select whichever platform you‚Äôre using, and follow the steps to install it on your device. Easy!

:warning: MetaMask does not have a  **mobile application** , not on Android or iOS, if there is one on the app store or play store that is most likely a fraudulent and scam. Do not use it. Read more about it on our [article](https://appbabylonia.medium.com/safety-tips-for-cryptocurrency-users-ver-001-9d5ad2e86632) we published on Medium.

Next, follow along with the setup specified by the app. Go ahead and click Create a Wallet. Write down the backup [seed phrase](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/seed-phrase) somewhere secret (preferably not on an Internet-connected device). Without this phrase, your funds can‚Äôt be recovered if your device is damaged or lost. Confirm that you‚Äôve written them down on the next page.

And that‚Äôs it! You should now see your wallet, ready to send and receive funds.




## Configuring the wallet

You might notice straight away that we‚Äôre still dealing with an [Ethereum](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-ethereum) wallet. The **BABY token**, the Babylonia.app native token is deployed on BNB Chain (BSC), Polygon and Fantom network. So, it is required that these networks to be added to the MetaMask original network list. 


‚ÑπÔ∏èDo not use MetaMask with Ethereum network, at best, this won‚Äôt work with BNB Chain(Binance Smart Chain or BSC) DApps. At worst, **you could lose funds by sending them to addresses you can‚Äôt actually use**.

There two methods to change and add extra networks, the manual way and using our "Babylonia Chain Selector" in the pool.babylonia.app page. So, let‚Äôs change that. 

### Manual Method
