## Gas Fees
Gas refers to **the fee required to conduct a transaction on the network successfully**. Gas fees are paid in network's native currency, ether (ETH), BNB (Binance Smart Chain), MATIC (Polygon), etc. Gas prices are denoted in gwei, which itself is a denomination & each gwei is equal to 0.000000001 (10 * 10 **-9). <br/>
The gas fee of a particular transaction can vary based on the business and activity (congestion) of the network and can rise to a very higher than normal amount. Therefore, the transaction 
may not confirm with a regular fee or delay significantly. To tackle the problem, you can increase the gas fee or try some other time when the network is less congested. <br/>

Some newer build networks like Polygon & Fantom has more gas fee fluctuations. You may need to edit the suggested gas fees:

Sometimes click doesn't though or the **Wallet Connect** is not responsive.

 1. Close the wallet connect.
 2. Refresh the page tab on your browser (with F5 or Control + F5).
 3. If the problem persists, close your browser or wallet and try again.
 4. Try to connect using different method, like with MetaMask instead of Trust Wallet.
