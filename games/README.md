### Classic Lottery

Lottery or Lucky draw is our simplest game, the player buys a lucky draw ticket, the system generates four random numbers from 1 to 9, the player is allowed to buy maximum 10 tickets on each round. Each ticket creates a unique set of numbers that can not be the same. When ticketing closes, the system creates a set of number based on the consequent random generator algorithm. The winner will be rewarded on how many numbers matches the ticket's number. The detail algorithm and winning conditions will be published. Different variety of lottery draws will be running. They differ from the complexity and chances of winning and also the ending timer. We're planning on having Weekly, Daily, and 6 hourly lottery at the beginning. Later on in the project, we will make required adjustments based on the performance and acceptance of the games by the crowd.



### Babylon Jackpot

Babylon Jackpot is modified version of Classic Lottery running only once a week. So it is smart contract based, prize accumulating scheme, has also the ticketing system, and uses chainlink VRF for the draws. The details will be updated shortly.
