# Bingo

~~Slow-Bingo is planned for GAME II phase of project, in 2022Q3 and afterwards.~~
After the founder's meeting with crypto professionals on 3. Sep.2022, we have decided to simplify the platform, clean up the clutter and postpone or cancel some projects, Bingo is currently canceled.

**Bingo**, also called **Lotto** in some places not in our platform though, a game of chance using cards on which there is a grid of numbers, a row of which constitute a win when they have been chosen at random. To play bingo, each player purchases one or more cards divided into numbered and blank squares. Randomly chosen numbers, usually up to 75 or 90, are called out by a “banker.” The first player to achieve a card (or a line) in which all the numbers have been called shouts “bingo” and collects the entire stake money (source: Britannica)&#x20;

In our version, the called out numbers will be picked based on the latest **blockhash** and converted directly to the designated range. In **Slow-Bingo**, the awareness of player is a must that the game may last for hours. Failing to call for Bingo offers the chance to another participant.
