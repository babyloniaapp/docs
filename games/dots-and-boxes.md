# Dots and Boxes

After the founder's meeting with crypto professionals on 3. Sep.2022, we have decided to simplify the platform, clean up the clutter and postpone or cancel some projects, Dots and Boxes is currently canceled.

The game starts with an empty grid of dots. Usually, two players take turns adding a single horizontal or vertical line between two free adjacent dots. A player who completes the fourth side of a 1Ã—1  box earns one point and takes another turn. A point is typically recorded by placing a mark that identifies the player in the box, such as an initial. The game ends when no more lines can be placed. The winner is the player with the most points. Will be available in 3x3, 5x5, 7x7 configurations.
