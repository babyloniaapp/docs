# ‚úåüèºTeam
I am Architect, me and my friend Bamzi started this after we have been scammed by a so called #DeFi #YieldFarming platform. We started this journey over a year ago. We had so many plans in mind, and also hurt by deceive and dark intentions of people with talent, so-called developers and programmers to con people, the community that are mostly less informed and most vulnerable. We said,  ‚Äúwhy are we not making a platform? It doesn't seem hard!!‚Äù, And I said ‚Äúwe make it right, we bring games, we provide real use cases, we offer transparency and honesty. Also, we make lots of money!‚Äù. So, we started gathering information and teaming up with professionals. <br/>

Unfortunately, Bamzi left the team on January 2022, fortunately for me, my dear friend, Dr. ALMA joint the team as the CMO, investor, and co-founder of the project.<br/>

What you see here is the result of daily hard work of few people who spend their free time, and own money, to pursue their passion, bring real use case to the crypto and give respect and transparency to community.  We try to run things better and at the end of the day make an honest earning.<br/>

Soon after we get established, register the company in a crypto-friendly land, we will go with full public identification. Just give us a few months until we get things right, complete our team and get a permanent location. I thank you in advance for being with us.<br/>
