<img width="800" alt="Role of blockchain in voting" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/babyloniaapp/docs/main/assets/gifs/Role-of-blockchain-in-voting.gif">

Here in [_<mark style="background-color:orange;">**babylonia.app**</mark>_](https://babylonia.app) we listen to people, first our stakeholders and then the players. Weekly proposals from the developer team, Babylonians and the community members will go live on the board, we discuss and vote for or against them. Each Babylonian with ~~10~~ **1000 BABY tokens** or more can be participating. Each ~~10~~ **1000 BABY tokens** will count as a one vote, the maximum voting power will be limited to **1,000,000 BABY tokens** per address. Non-Babylonian can create a proposal, but can not cast a vote. 

The proposals that fail to acquire enough attention or vote will be discarded soon. The amount of proposal per wallet address per week will be limited to the amount of staking Baby tokens. However, we always welcome suggestions, ideas and constructive criticizes about the platform, feel free to contact us through medians, we will be happy to hear from you.
