Our initial goal is to distribute BABY token among different blockchains, starting with BSC to the Polygon and later into the Fantom. For this purpose, the **Baby** token will be bridged to other blockchains. We will **NOT** exceed the max supply but to distribute it proportionally based on performance, demand and number of users on the particular blockchain.&#x20;

It is a long way to go, we are working on it, stay put and keep looking up!
